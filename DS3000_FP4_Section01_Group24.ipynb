    "\n",
    "We want to analyze data about applications from the Google Play Store in order to find the factors that have the most effect on the rating (out of five) presented on the Google Play Store. Potential factors include category, genre, number of installs, and the number of reviews. We plan on using these factors as features to predict the rating of an application. With this, we can learn about which features are more significant in determining the rating and in what way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance of the Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a platform for creating applications for use on phones, there are many features of a Google Play Application, ranging from average rating among users, genre, and download count, to name a few. With phones being such an important part of daily life (and Google Play Store supplying applications to a large majority of phone users), it is important to understand not only how current applications have faired on the market, but also what features distinguish good apps from bad apps, which allow us and developers to hone in on certain features of applications during development to improve user experience and popularity for new applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another person has conducted a similar experiement has us while using the same dataset from Kaggle. You can click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jemseow/machine-learning-to-predict-app-ratings) to read about it. This person opted into using three models: linear regression, the SVR model, and the random forest regressor model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the aforementioned problem and its importance, we set out to tackle the following questions:\n",
    "- Which process will yield the best results: classification or regression?\n",
    "    - Using our ratings target variable as continuous values or discretizing them for classification\n",
    "    - Whether leaving the target as a continuous variable for regression will yield better results than doing some pre-processing to turn this into a classification problem\n",
    "- Which classification algorithms will have the easiest time fitting to the data?\n",
    "    - KNN, decision trees, LinearSVC\n",
    "- Which classification algorithm will end up with the highest testing accuracy?\n",
    "- What is the difference in performance between decision trees and KNN?\n",
    "    - This is important due to our large number of features being used\n",
    "    - KNN usually does better on datasets with less features\n",
    "    - Decision trees might have an easier time because there are more\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For hypothesis testing, we will be testing if a higher number of installs means that the rating is also higher. We will also be testing if a lower number of reviews means that the rating will be higher. By using various classification and regression algorithms, we will be able to answer the questions mentioned above and test our hypothesis. These questions and their respective answers will help us as developers and data analysis to see whether popularity or urge to write a review necessarily constitutes to a higher rating. \n"

Other features such as the number of installs and reviews may also be important as the average rating may vary more with less number of users using/reviewing it. This is a supervised ML problem because we have our ten features as inputs and mapping it to a single output, the rating.
